            <p class="mt-20"><span class="font_bold">Before Paul Allen and Bill Gates</span> co-founded Microsoft, they
                were avid computer geeks in an age when
                access to computers was hard to come by. Allen and Gates even skipped high school classes to live
                and breathe in their school's computer room. Eventually, they hacked the school's computer and were
                caught, but instead of being expelled, they were offered unlimited computer time in exchange for
                helpingto improve the school computer's performance.With the help of partner Paul Gilbert, Gates
                and Allen ran their own small company, Traf-O-Data, while in high school and sold a computer to the
                city of Seattle for counting city traffic.</p>
            <p class="mt-20"><span class="font_bold">Where the Name 'Microsoft' Came From</span> <br>
                On July 29, 1975, Gates used the name "Micro-Soft"—which had been suggested by Allen—in a letter
                to Allen referring to their partnership. The name, a portmanteau of "microcomputer" and "software,"
                was registered with the New Mexico secretary of state on Nov. 26, 1976. In August 1977, less than
                a year later, the company opened its first international office. The branch, located in Japan, was
                called ASCII Microsoft. In 1979, the company moved to Bellevue, Washington, and two years later
                it incorporated under the name Microsoft Inc. Gates was president of the company and chairman
                of the board, and Allen was executive vice president.</p>

                <span class="font_bold">Microsoft Operating Systems</span>
                An operating system is a fundamental software that allows a computer to operate. As a newly
                formed company, Microsoft's first operating system product to be publicly released was a version
                of Unix called Xenix, released in 1980. Xenix was later used as the basis for Microsoft's first word
                processor Multi-Tool Word, a predecessor to Microsoft Word.
