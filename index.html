                        by Microsoft and introduced in 1985. The system is available in more than 100 languages and is
                        used by millions of people worldwide, being the world’s most popular operating system for
                        personal computers.</p>

                    <p><span class="large_font">Microsoft Windows</span> was announced by Bill Gates on
                        November 10, 1983.[1] Microsoft introduced Windows as a graphical
                        user interface for MS-DOS, which had been introduced two years
                        earlier.[2] The product line evolved in the 1990s from an operating
                        environment into a fully complete, modern operating system over
                        two lines of development, each with their own separate codebase.</p>
                    <p class="margin_top_hero"><span class="large_font">The First versions</span> of Windows (1.0
                        through to 3.11) were graphical
                        shells that ran from MS-DOS. Windows 95, though still being based
                        on MS-DOS, was its own operating system, using a 16-bit DOS-based
                        kernel[citation needed] and a 32-bit user space. Windows 95
                        introduced many features that have been part of the product
                        ever since, including the Start menu, the taskbar, and Windows
                        Explorer (renamed File Explorer in Windows 8). In 1997,
                        Microsoft released Internet Explorer 4 which included the (at the
                        time controversial) Windows Desktop Update. It aimed to integrate
                        Internet Explorer and the web into the user interface and also brought
                        many new features into Windows, such as the ability to display JPEG
                        mages as the desktop wallpaper and single window navigation
                        in Windows Explorer. In 1998,
                        Microsoft released Windows 98, which also included the Windows
                        Desktop Update and Internet Explorer 4 by default.
                        The inclusion of Internet Explorer 4 and the Desktop Update
                        ed to ananti-trust case in the United States. Windows 98
                        included USB support out of the box, and also plug and play, which
                        allows devices to work when plugged in without
                        requiring a system reboot or manual configuration. Windows Me, the
                        last DOS-based version of Windows, was aimed
                        at consumers and released in 2000. It introduced System Restore,
                        Help and Support Center, updated versions of the
                        Disk Defragmenter and other system tools.</p>
